# Chapter 1 : Structure

### HTML describes the structure of pages

HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets called HTML **elements**.
* Elements are made up of two tags:
  1. opening tag
  2. closing tag
    * The closing tag has an extra forward slash (/) 
* Tags act like containers.
  * <html> indicates anything within this tag is HTML code
  * <body> indicates anything within this tag should be shown inside the main browser window
  * Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
