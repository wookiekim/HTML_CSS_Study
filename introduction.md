## The structure of this book

The book is divided into three sections:

1. ***HTML***

Start by writing down what you want to appear on your page, then add tags or elements to the words so the browser knows where each word, sentence, paragraph goes.

This section introduces the tags, grouped into chapters on:
  * text
  * lists 
  * links
  * images
  * tables
  * forms
  * video audio
  * flash
  * miscellaneous elements

2. ***CSS***

CSS controls the styling and layout of web pages.

CSS properties fall into one of two categories:

  * *Presentation*
How to control colour of text, fonts, size, background colours, background images...
  * *Layout*
How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen, and how professionals make their pages more attractive.

3. ***Practical***

New tags to be introduced in HTML5

Putting the website on the web, SEO, and using google analytics

## How people access the web

* Browsers
Popular exxamples: Firefox, Chrome, Safari..

You cannot rely on all visitors to your site being able to use the latest functionality offered in all browsers.

* Web Servers
Hosts the website. Are special computers that are constantly connected to the internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them.

* Devices
Includes Desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

They may vary in screen sizes, the connection speeds with the web.

* Screen Readers
Programs that read out the contents of a screen to a user. Commonly used by people with visual impairments.

Many laws have been passed that require websites be accessible to those with disabilities. May also be used to people who are driving or jogging (cannot simultaneously look at scrren)

## How websites are created

Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS.

Larger websites (in particular that are updated regularly using CMS, blogging tools, or e-commerce software) make use of more complex technologies.

Larger websites may also use a databse to store data, and programming languages such as PHP, ASP.Net, Java or Ruby on the web server. 

**HTML 5 and CSS 3** were in development when the book was written. 

## How the web works

The web server hosting the site could be anywhere in the world.

THe browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server to find the location of the web server.

1. Connect to the web via an ISP (Internet Service Provider)
2. Computer contacts network of servers called the DNS.
  * DNS act like phonebooks: tells your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name
  * Every device on the web has a unique IP address.
3. The unique number DNS server returns allows your browser to contact the web server hosting the website you requested.
4. The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

```Question
How do you upload (or register) your web server's address on the DNS?
